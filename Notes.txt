Notes for Our Idea: 
Variables 
- FUEL, WATER, ENERGY, FOOD

- Having Maps represent biomes or environments to manage 
- Having each biome associated with real world stats of sustainability 
- The player will... build things to affect resources and "sustainaility levels" 
- The goal, for each biome, is to establish "100% happiness" within the biome to "complete it" 
- Have "random events" where a real-world policy is implemented, which affects the resource distribution or levels of a given biome 
   - (i.e. The Gloab Warming Solutions Acts [2008] requires the state to reduce total greenhouse gas to at least 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and to at least 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050)
   - (this would be implemented via an event where the FUEL EMISSIONS would slowly reduce for a certain amount of time)
